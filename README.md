## Product Vision Statement

SwapBay empowers people to exchange value, not just money.  
By supporting both cash offers and item-for-item trades, the platform promotes sustainable reuse and creates an inclusive marketplace for students, hobbyists, and local communities.  

The goal of SwapBay is to make secondhand exchange accessible, affordable, and environmentally friendly, encouraging users to trade what they have for what they need.

## Project History

The idea for SwapBay emerged during the Fall 2025 Agile Software Development & DevOps course.  
Our team observed that most online marketplaces only allow cash-based transactions, which limits flexibility and accessibility for many users.  

SwapBay addresses this by introducing the option to exchange goods directly through swaps, in addition to traditional buy-and-sell transactions.  
This dual-offer model promotes sustainable consumption and encourages community engagement through a circular exchange economy.

The project follows an Agile/SCRUM development process, with iterative sprints, peer reviews, and continuous feedback loops.
